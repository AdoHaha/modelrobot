MyModelRobot
==========

MyModelRobot is an online application for designing and viewing robots described in URDF ( Unified Robot Description Format) used in ROS. 

The tool focus in on simplicity of use, especially for teaching and rapid prototyping. The tool is used in Lodz University of Technology robotics curriculum (basics of robotics, mobile robotics and project work).

At the current state, the tool is capable of presenting URDF's with geometrical shapes, but not with meshes. You can move robot's joints using sliders and animate robots via CSV files also you can view robots using Augmented Reality (AR)
