MyModelRobot
==========

MyModelRobot is an online application for designing and viewing robots described in URDF ( Unified Robot Description Format) used in ROS. 

The tool focus in on simplicity of use, especially for teaching and rapid prototyping. The tool is used in Lodz University of Technology robotics curriculum (basics of robotics, mobile robotics and project work).

At the current state, tool is capable of presenting URDF's with geometrical shapes, but not with meshes. Robot's joints can be moved, some simple animations can be be implemented via CSV files and robots can be viewed in Augmented Reality (AR).
